## Why i writing in English ?
As an chinese people, why i writing articles or codes in English.
The primitive reason as following:
1. English is the most commonly spoken language in the world.
2. Improve my English skills in reading and writing.
3. An medium to communicate with others.

Unfortunately, I have an **poor English**, so **forgive me**.

**I will fix those articles irregularly until they are acceptable**.
