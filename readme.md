## Why i writing in English ?
As an chinese people, why i writing articles or codes in English.
The primitive reason as following:
1. English is the most commonly spoken language in the world.
2. Improve my English skills in reading and writing.
3. An medium to communicate with others.

Unfortunately, I have an **poor English**, so **forgive me**.

**I will fix those articles irregularly until they are acceptable**.

## Leetcode related
Some sections may be contact with `leetcode` problems, the implements can be found in:
-  [leetcode](https://github.com/hsjfans/leetcode)
-  [online judge](https://github.com/hsjfans/Online-Judge#Leetcode)


This repository contains the fundamental data structures and algorithms. 

Each of them has its own separated `README.MD`,implement and some simply instances of applications ;

**Note that** ⚠️ this project is aimed at learning and researching purposes only, Using in production isn.t the purpose .

## Data Structures
> The data structure is the basic skeleton of the computer system, which is a collection of elements that have one or more specific relationships with each other,contains some corresponding functions or methods also.
